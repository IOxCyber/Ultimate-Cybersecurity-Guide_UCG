1. Infoga: `Email information gathering tool`, collects senders' identities, IPs, mail servers, and checks email leaks.
2. Service-based solutions: `Protocol and service-specific scanning`, builds inventory of running services before vulnerability assessment.
3. Replay attack: `Captures and replays signals`, typically targeting IoT device communications.
4. Docker Daemon: `Core Docker service`, processes API requests and manages containers, images, volumes, and networks.
5. Agent-based scanner: `Vulnerability scanner installed on endpoint`, scans machines locally for vulnerabilities.
6. TCP/IP hijacking: `Intercept and take over a TCP connection`, attacker predicts ISN to hijack the session.
7. Dragonblood: `WPA3 vulnerability`, targets flaws in WPA3 handshake protocols.
8. Private key usage: `Used for Decryption, Signing`, decrypts signatures made by the owner.
9. Public key usage: `Used for encryption`, encrypts data intended for the private key holder.
```
âœ… Bottom Line for Memory:
ðŸ”¸ Asymmetric: "Lock with Public, Open with Private." eg. RSA, ECC, DSA & Used in SSL/TLS, PGP (email encryption).
ðŸ”¸ Symmetric: "Same key is your sword and your shield." eg. AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish & Used in Encrypting files, VPN tunnels.
```
10. Public keys sharing: `Public keys are shared openly`, in asymmetric cryptography.

11. ACK flag probe scan: `Sends ACK probes`, interprets RST responses to determine closed ports.
12. Fileless malware: `Malware operates without files`, evades traditional antivirus and application whitelisting.
13. .bash_history in Linux: `Stores shell command history`, must be cleared to remove plaintext login/password data.
14. Agent Smith attack: `Replaces apps with malicious versions`, spreads via third-party app stores.
15. FCC ID search: `Search IoT device info`, finds models and certifications using FCC database.
16. msfencode: `Bypasses antivirus`, encodes payloads to avoid detection.
17. DHCP starvation: `Exhausts DHCP IP pool`, prevents legitimate users from obtaining IP addresses.
18. Impersonation attack: `Masquerading as trusted entity`, to gain physical access and gather information.
19. HIPAA/PHI: `Protects health information`, U.S. law for safeguarding medical data privacy.
20. SSH client/server identification: `Based on port 22`, source IP with random high port is client, destination with port 22 is server.
21. Session cookie stealing script: `Steals session cookies`, hidden behind image tags in forums via JavaScript injection.
22. VRFY: `SMTP command to verify users`, used during enumeration attacks.
23. Advanced persistent threat (APT): `Stealthy, prolonged network attack`, extracts sensitive information without disruption.
24. MIB_II.MIB (Management Information Base II): `Standard MIB for SNMP`, used to manage various network devices, including workstations, servers, and other network services.
