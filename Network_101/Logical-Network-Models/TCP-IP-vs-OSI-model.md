## Basics:
-  Both models gives a `way of transmitting data over the internet.`
- was driven by the `need for standardization and a systematic approach to understanding and implementing network communication.`
-  `need for devices from different manufacturers to communicate`
- `breaking down the complex task of network communication into manageable parts`

## TCP vs OSI: `Protocol vs Reference Model`

## 1. TCP/IP; `4 Layers`
- Practical model that addresses specific communication challenges and relies on standardized protocols.
- Widely implemented in the ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet & designed and developed by the United States Department of Defense.

```
Link Layer (or Network Access Layer)
Internet Layer
Transport Layer
Application Layer
```


## 2. OSI serves: `7 Layers`
- a comprehensive, protocol-independent framework designed to encompass various network communication methods.
- It was introduced later as a conceptual framework in the late 1970s by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

| Site/Service          | Layer-Related Examples                                        |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Wireshark**         | Captures traffic from L1‚ÄìL7 (great for analyzing all layers)  |
| **BurpSuite**         | Focuses on L7 (Application Layer attacks)                     |
| **Cisco Routers**     | Operate primarily on L3 (Routing/IP-based decisions)          |
| **Firewalls (Palo Alto, CheckPoint)** | Inspect L3‚ÄìL7 depending on NGFW capabilities   |
| **VoIP Services (Zoom, Skype)** | Use L5‚ÄìL7: SIP, RTP, TLS                             |
