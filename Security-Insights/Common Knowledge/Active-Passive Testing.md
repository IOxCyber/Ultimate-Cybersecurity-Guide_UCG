Testing Type	What (Purpose)	Why (Use of it)	Examples / Methods	Extras (Alternatives & Notes)

Passive Testing	Understanding appâ€™s behavior, structure, and logic without altering it.	To collect intelligence safely before attacking (reconnaissance).	â€¢ HTTP request/response observation<br>â€¢ Header analysis<br>â€¢ Discovering endpoints (via Burp Suite, ZAP, etc.)<br>â€¢ Tech stack fingerprinting (via Wappalyzer, WhatWeb)<br>â€¢ API schema review	â€¢ No payloads or intrusive actions<br>â€¢ Silent â€” doesnâ€™t modify server state.
Active Testing	Interacting directly with the app to find vulnerabilities by sending crafted inputs or manipulating requests.	To verify, exploit, and confirm security weaknesses.	â€¢ SQLi, XSS, CSRF testing<br>â€¢ Authentication, Authorization, Session management checks<br>â€¢ Input validation and error handling tests<br>â€¢ Cryptography and business logic testing<br>â€¢ API fuzzing	â€¢ Verbose/noisy â€” can trigger alerts/logs.<br>â€¢ Tools: Burp Intruder, SQLMap, OWASP ZAP Active Scan, wfuzz, etc.

ðŸ§  Key Insights (Keep it crisp & practical)

1. Passive = Observation mode â†’ Like a spy listening to conversations.


2. Active = Engagement mode â†’ Like a hacker testing the locks.


3. Passive gives intel, Active gives proof.


4. Use Passive before Active â€” it helps you plan precise attacks and avoid unnecessary noise.

ðŸ’¡ Real-Life Implementation

Passive: While mapping Uberâ€™s APIs, a tester observes traffic using Burp Proxy to note hidden endpoints and headers.

Active: Later, the tester fuzzes those endpoints to check for IDOR or injection flaws.
