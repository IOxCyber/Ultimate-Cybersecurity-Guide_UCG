- Server, Email DB, Account Creds, List out all assets.
- Asset components as well, data flows within assets/network.

### Types: Method, Process, Strength, Weaknesses.
1. PASTA (Process For Attack Simulation and threat Analysis) - 7 steps, risk centric.
- Simulating real world attack scenarios.
2. TRIKE (Open source methodology, Risk mgmt focused, complex) includes STRIDE,DREAD.
3. OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation)
4. DREAD (Damage potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability)

## 2. Attacker Centric:
- AKA Security Centric
- Create a list of Threat actors & how they can affect the application.
- Brainstorming, Overlooks technical threats.
- Moreover Human prone approach
### Types:
1. VAST (Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat modeling)
2. Security Decision Trees (Brainstorming)

## 3. Application Centric:
- Focus on Application
- Deep understanding of the App & it's components.
- Assess Users

### Types:
1. STRIDE (6 Categories i.e Spoofing, Tempering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, DoS, Elevation of Privilege)
2. LINDDUN (Linkability, Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of information, Unawareness, Non-compliance) - Privacy Focused
3. OWASP Top 10 is a Threat Catalogue (reference only, not a Threat modeling type.
