## Key Highlights

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Type** | Framework (methodology, not a software tool) |
| **Purpose** | Identify, assess, and manage information security risks |
| **Focus** | Builds a **risk-aware culture** in **mid to large organizations** |
| **Approach** | Self-directed — performed by internal staff, not external auditors |
| **Nature** | Qualitative, documentation-heavy, focused on people, process, and technology |

## 4 Main Steps

1. **Develop Risk Measurement Criteria**  
   → Define what “risk” means to the organization (impact, likelihood, etc.)

2. **Profile the Assets**  
   → Identify critical assets (data, systems, processes)

3. **Identify & Document Threats**  
   → Determine possible threats and vulnerabilities to those assets

4. **Mitigate the Risks**  
   → Develop and implement risk mitigation strategies
