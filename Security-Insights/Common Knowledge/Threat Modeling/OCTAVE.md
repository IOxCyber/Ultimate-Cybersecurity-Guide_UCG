# OCTAVE-S Threat Modeling

## Definition
**OCTAVE-S (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation – Simplified)**

It helps identify, prioritize, and manage information security risks by focusing on **organizational practices, assets, and threats** rather than just technology.
