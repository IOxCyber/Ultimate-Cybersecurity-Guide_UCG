# Which Threat Modeling Methodology to Select::

## Core Idea:
An organization can **adopt any one or a combination** of threat modeling methodologies based on its **environment, goals, and maturity**.

## Methodology Types:
| Type | Focus | When to Use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Application-Centric** | Based on system design, data flow, components | For **developers** & **app security** focus |
| **Asset-Centric** | Protects key assets (data, services, infra) | For **risk management** & **data-sensitive** environments |
| **Attacker-Centric** | Identifies threats from attacker’s perspective | For **red team**, **pen testers**, or **offensive security** |
| **Hybrid Approach** | Combines multiple methods | For **mature orgs** needing full visibility |

## Example:
A DevSecOps-driven company may use:
- **Application-Centric** → for app threat modeling (e.g., STRIDE)
- **Asset-Centric** → for risk prioritization (e.g., PASTA)
- **Attacker-Centric** → for simulating attack paths (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK)

## Summary:
👉 Choose or combine methodologies to best fit your **security goals, workflow, and maturity** — there’s no one-size-fits-all.
