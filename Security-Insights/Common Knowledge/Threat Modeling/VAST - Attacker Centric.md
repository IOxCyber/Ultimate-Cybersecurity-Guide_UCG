- **Types:**  
  - **Application Threat Modeling:** Focuses on app architecture, data flow, and vulnerabilities.  
  - **Operational Threat Modeling:** Focuses on infrastructure, deployment, and DevOps risks.  
- **Nature:** Proprietary (no public documentation for implementation).  
- **Goal:** Make threat modeling repeatable and integrated into Agile/DevOps workflows.

## Supporting Tools:
- **ThreatModeler** (Primary tool supporting VAST)  
- **JIRA / Confluence** (for workflow and documentation integration)  
- **CI/CD Platforms** (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions for automation)

## Summary:
VAST is a **framework**, not a tool.  
It’s **proprietary**, designed for **Agile scalability**, and mainly supported by **ThreatModeler**.
