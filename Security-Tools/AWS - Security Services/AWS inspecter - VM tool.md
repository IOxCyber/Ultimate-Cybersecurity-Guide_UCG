It automatically scans the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, container images and repositories residing in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR), and AWS Lambda functions in your AWS environment. After the assessment, it produces a detailed list of security findings that is organized by level of severity.


Integrate with AWS Security Hub and Amazon EventBridge to automate workflows, ticket routing, and remediation.
