# Burp-focused Manual Testing Checklist

| Vulnerability | One-line definition | Burp tool approach | Payload (short) | Where to test (general) | Expected result |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| DOM-based XSS | Client-side script injection via unsafe DOM sinks | Proxy + DOM Invader + Repeater in a real browser session | `location.hash="<script>alert(1)</script>"` | SPA pages, hash handlers, client-side templates | Script executes in victim browser context |
| Authentication bypass / IDOR | Accessing other users' data by tampering IDs/credentials | Repeater + Autorize + manual JWT/param tampering | Modify `user_id=123` or tamper JWT `sub` claim | Object endpoints, profile APIs, file access endpoints | Access/modify another user's data or actions |
| Business logic flaw | Workflow abuse that breaks intended rules or limits | Repeater + Intruder + manual multi-step replay | Change `price`/`quantity` between checkout steps | Checkout, promo, refund, multi-step workflows | Rules bypassed (free/reduced price, duplicated credit) |
| File upload bypass / RCE | Uploaded file executed or misinterpreted as code | Repeater + Tamper Content-Type/extension + Collaborator verification | `shell.php.jpg` with `<?php system($_GET['c']); ?>` | Avatar/docs upload, image processors, import endpoints | Uploaded file executes or is accessible as code |
| Deserialization (untrusted) | Unsafe object parsing leads to arbitrary code or object control | Repeater + custom gadget payloads + Burp Collaborator | Language-specific gadget payload (e.g., Java serialized payload) | Endpoints accepting serialized objects, "data" fields | RCE or arbitrary object manipulation/behavior |
| Race condition / concurrency | State corruption from concurrent requests/timing | Turbo Intruder or scripted concurrent requests | Send two `POST /checkout` concurrently | Checkout, payment, transfer endpoints | Double-spend or inconsistent/incorrect state |
| API mass-assignment | Unfiltered binding updates sensitive model fields | Proxy + Param Miner + Repeater; tamper JSON body | Add `"isAdmin": true` in JSON body | API object update endpoints accepting JSON | Sensitive attribute changed; privilege escalation |
| Session issues (fixation/entropy) | Reusable/predictable session tokens or fixation flows | Sequencer + Repeater (reuse/expiry/side-by-side tests) | Reuse old session ID or set cookie to known value | Auth flows, session cookie endpoints, login flows | Session persists after logout or tokens predictable |
| Blind / Time-based SQLi | Injection detectable only via response timing or side-effects | Repeater/Intruder + manual timing payloads (or sqlmap via Burp) | `' OR IF(1=1,SLEEP(5),0)-- -` | ID/query params
