### 🔍 Is Nikto a Web App Security Scanner?
- **No**, Nikto is **not** a full-fledged **Web Application Security Scanner**. It is better described as a `web server vulnerability scanner`.

### More Info:

| Criteria                         | Nikto                                                 | True Web App Security Scanners      |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Scope**                        | Web **servers** (Apache, Nginx, IIS, etc.)             | Web **applications** (logic, input, session) |
| **Checks**                       | Outdated software, open dirs, default files, bad headers | XSS, SQLi, CSRF, IDOR, logic flaws |
| **Interacts with App Logic?**    | ❌ No (static behavior)                                | ✅ Yes (parameter fuzzing, input validation) |
| **Authentication Testing?**     | ❌ No                                                  | ✅ Yes                              |
| **JavaScript Handling?**        | ❌ None                                                | ✅ Yes (Burp, ZAP, etc. parse JS)   |
| **Stealth/Evasion?**            | ❌ Loud and obvious                                    | ✅ Possible in tools like Burp      |
| **Use Case**                     | Recon, quick enumeration of server-side weaknesses     | Deep dive into app-level flaws      |

### In Simple Terms:
- **Nikto** is like knocking on all the doors and checking if any are unlocked, rusty, or open.
- **Web app security scanners** (like Burp, ZAP, Acunetix) actually try to *get inside*, mess with your stuff, check how you validate input, how you manage sessions, and whether you leak data or allow privilege escalation.

---

### ✅ So what is Nikto *good* for?
1. `First-pass recon of a web server` before deeper testing.
2. Spotting low-hanging fruit like:
   - `/phpinfo.php`, `/test/`, `/admin/`
   - Dangerous HTTP methods enabled (`PUT`, `TRACE`)
   - Old Apache versions vulnerable to DoS
3. Great for quick scans on CTFs, vulnerable labs (like Metasploitable), or during external perimeter assessments.

### Real-life Comparison

| Tool        | When You Might Use It                    |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Nikto**   | You just found a web server during recon and want to quickly see if it’s leaking anything. |
| **OWASP ZAP** | You're testing the login, checkout page, and input validation. |
| **Burp Suite Pro** | You're hunting deep bugs in an authenticated session with CSRF tokens and JSON APIs. |

### ✅ Web Servers Nikto Can Scan
- Nikto doesn’t care much about what the server is, as long as it serves HTTP/S. It's protocol-agnostic to some extent.
```
Web Server	     | Supported	| Notes
Apache	✅     | Yes	      | Most common target, tons of tests
Nginx	✅        | Yes      	| Less verbose results unless misconfigured
Microsoft IIS ✅| Yes   | 	Identifies IIS version, default files, and vulnerabilities
Lighttpd	✅     | Yes         | 	Some specific checks available
Tomcat (Java)✅  | Yes     | 	Checks for manager console, default creds

WebDAV            | 	✅ Yes | 	Methods like PUT, DELETE, PROPFIND
Python SimpleHTTP | 	✅ Yes | 	Identifies lack of auth, indexing
Jetty             | 	✅ Yes | Limited checks, but still recognized
Node.js (Express) | 	✅ Yes | 	Detects headers, exposes default files
Weblogic/WebSpher | 	✅ Yes | 	Version + outdated components if visible
Custom/Embedded (IoT)	 | ✅ Yes | 	If it speaks HTTP, Nikto can scream at it

```

### ❌ What It Does NOT Do Well:
```
Limitations	 | Description
🔇 HTTPS-only misconfigs	 | May not catch deep cert issues unless combined with tools like SSLyze
🚫 API Scanning (REST/JSON)	 | Nikto doesn't parse JSON well — better use tools like Postman, Burp, or ZAP
🔒 Authenticated Pages | 	Nikto does not handle login forms or tokens
🧠 Logic-based attacks | 	Doesn’t follow redirects or complex logic
🔍 Stealth Mode	 | It’s LOUD. Not suitable for stealth engagements (no IDS evasion)
```
