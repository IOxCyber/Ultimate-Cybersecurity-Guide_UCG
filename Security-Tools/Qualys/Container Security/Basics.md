## Container Security:
Process of implementing the security tools and policies to protect the infrastructure(where the docker engine running, storage), software supply chain, runtime & everything in between.(eg CICD build pipeline, registery)


## Security Challenges:
It's different from traditional security `due to Complexity & Dynamism of the container environment.` like ephemeral (short lived), stateless by design.

eg. Containers get terminated, created very frequently by Orchestrated tools.

## Key Points:
- Patching and vulnerability remediation must be done on images not on containers.
