## Need of reliable way to discover, assess and monitor the APIs for data protection & compliance.

1. Comprehensive Discovery
- Auto detect all APIs (Interni, external, rogue and undocumented)

2. Specification Conformance
- Validates APIs against OpenAPI v3 standards.


3. Vulnerability Testing
- Performed OWASP API Security top 10 with Active & passives scans.

4. Risk-Based Prioritisation with TruRisk
- Evaluates findings based on business impact & exploitability.
