## 1. To add a web App:
- Qualys > Web App Security > WAS > Web App > New > Add.
- Link: Total number of crawled Links from the page.
- Integration: Thru Burp, BugCrowd, Plugins etc
 
## 2. Fault injection vs. manual:
- Fault injection: Automated Testing (Fast)
- Manual: Thru Burp Integration (To discover Design flaws)

## 3. WAS Workflow:
- The workflow for analyzing a Web application involves five simple
- Steps: 1) Define Web Application, 2) Perform Discovery Scan—Crawl, 3) Perform Vulnerability Scan, 4) Create Reports, and 5) Fix Vulnerabilities
```
Here is a detailed view of this workflow:
1. Define Web Application
• Identify the location (URL) of the Web App
• Define the “scope” of the Web App Crawl
• Choose from various scanning options—Option Profile:
• Select a scanner appliance
• Include “crawling hints” and/or header injection
• Use optional DNS Override
• Provide authentication credentials
- Form records
- Server records
• Identify areas to “white list” or “black list”
• Enable malware monitoring
2. Perform Discovery Scan (Crawl)
3. Perform Vulnerability Scan
4. Create reports to identify links crawled and vulnerabilities detected
5. Fix vulnerabilities
```
