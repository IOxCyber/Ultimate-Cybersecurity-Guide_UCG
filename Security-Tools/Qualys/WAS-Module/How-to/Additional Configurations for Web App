Below Options can be enabled when setting up an App.

WAS > Web App > Authentication Record


1. Authentication Records — Store and replay login flows/credentials so the scanner can test authenticated fields. USE NON-PRIVILEGE ACCOUNTS.
Using Records Methods (Basic/Form/NTLM).

2. Header Injection — Add/override HTTP headers to test header-based behavior and WAF/proxy rules.

3. API Endpoint Definition — explicitly declare REST API endpoints (method, params, body, headers)  Using Postman collection, Burp Proxy Capture, Swagger/OpenAPI File.

4. Set Up Exclusion Lists — exclude urls, parameters from scans by doing whitelist/blacklist in the app using Allow List ( Urls, Regular Expressions), Exclude List etc.

5. Default DNS Override — ??

6. Redundant Links — Specify redundant links to reduce crawl noise and repeated findings. Links can be specify as Regex to match a list of links.

eg. http://www.example.com/products/prod[1-99].html

7. Path Fuzzing Rules — supply wordlists and rules to brute-force hidden files/directories and endpoints in {} to perform fault injection tests (SQLi, XSS etc)

eg. http://www.abc/issue/{issue}/section/{section}/article/{article}

8. Form Training — provide valid inputs and train scanners to submit complex multi-step forms correctly.

9. Malware Monitoring — continuously check for injected scripts, malware signatures, and blacklist status.
